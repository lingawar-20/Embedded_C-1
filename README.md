### LED Actuator that indicates the status of the heater and presence of the driver

#### LED glows when both the heater is ON and the driver is seated

#### LED doesn't glow when 

##### The heater is OFF and the driver is not seated
![OFF](https://github.com/12345292/Embedded_C/blob/main/Simulation/Output_1.png)

##### Either the heater is not ON or the driver is not present
